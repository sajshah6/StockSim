112 Term Project

Description: My app hopes to help investors make an educated decision on the stocks they wish to buy. It does so in two ways. The first way is that it will allow users to track the progression of a portfolio that they created overtime. They can see the value of these stocks at certain time periods as well as the growth of the portfolio overtime. The second way is that they can see specific models designed to give insight into the future of a certain stock. They can also see related statistics on the stock about its future approximations.

Libraries Used: yfinance, tkinter, cmu_112_graphics, decimal, dataclasses, copy
