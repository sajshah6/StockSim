My app hopes to help investors make an educated decision on the stocks they wish to buy. It does so in two ways. The first way is that it will allow users to track the progression of a portfolio that they created overtime. They can see the value of the stocks they chose at certain time periods as well as the growth of the overall portfolio. The second way is that they can analyze specific models designed to give insight into the future of a certain stock. They can also see related statistics on the stock's future approximations and my recommendation on how to manage the current stock holdings.
